- Deployment considerations for cross-platform applications

**Prerequisite:** CS 234  
**Primary Development Tools:** Android Studio, Java (or Dart for semester projects)  
**Platform Focus:** Android (primary), iOS (via semester project)  

## Assignments and Prototypes
This repository includes rapid prototypes created using Android Studio. These prototypes focused on honing Android development skills through small, iterative projects.

### Semester Project: ENMUmobile
The final project for the course, **ENMUmobile**, was a cross-platform mobile application designed for both Android and iOS. It was developed using Dart and Flutter for cross-platform compatibility and deployed successfully on both platforms.  
The project repository is hosted separately and can be accessed here:  
[ENMUmobile GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nwc6624/ENMU_CS_458_Semester_Project)
